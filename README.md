# BlueMarble

## App Project

Project built for the 2020 NASA Space Apps Challenge

## Basics

The BlueMarbleApp has the purpose to connect people around the world, especially during this tough time of social isolation. Users are able to create or join a live conference and share their experiences. They can also join a conference with astronauts, who will talk about the Astronomic Picture of the Day which is retrieved from NASA's API, while keeping them company during their journey in space.

The app also displays facts, using worldwide data from NASA's open-sources, addressing the changes that occurred in the environment during this isolation period and up-to-date information about the COVID-19.

## APIs 

We used a couple of APIs to build the app. It's core was made using HTML, CSS and Javascript - with a NoSQL database on Google Firebase Real-time database. The external-api from Jitsi Meet was used to achive video-call capabilities. NASA's imagery were used across to app.

## COVID MAP

The COVID Map was build over the trackcorona.live/api - enabling users to enter a video-call room for each country. While exploring the map, users can navigate through Nasa's night lights map and learn about the coronavirus situation on each country (confirmed cases, deaths and recovered cases). 

## PWA
The app is also offered as a Progressive Web App.
