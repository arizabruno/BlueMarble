# BlueMarble

## App Project

Project built for the 2020 NASA Space Apps Challenge

## Basics

The BlueMarble App enables users to create video-call rooms and share them with the world. Each room is open for up to 3 hours, with a marker in an approximate coordinate. Users can choose their language, theme, description and title.

## APIs 

We used a couple of APIs to build the app. It's core was made using HTML, CSS and Javascript - with a NoSQL database on Google Firebase Real-time database. The external-api from Jitsi Meet was used to achive video-call capabilities. NASA's imagery were used across to app.

## COVID MAP

The COVID Map was build over the trackcorona.live/api - enabling users to enter a video-call room for each country. While exploring the map, users can navigate through Nasa's night lights map and learn about the coronavirus situation on each country (confirmed cases, deaths and recovered cases).
